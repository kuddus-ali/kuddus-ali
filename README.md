# Hi there, I'm Kuddus Ali 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
Just another coder on the internet, exploring, tinkering, and occasionally building something cool.

## 🛠️ Random Facts About Me
- I love to push code and see what breaks (and then fix it!).
- My repos are a mix of experiments, tiny tools, and things that made me curious.
- Sometimes I contribute, sometimes I just lurk.  
- Always learning, always building.
